# usbWAinstaller

So, this is just a simple script i've wrote that installs WhatsApp to an Android device, just by running it
Why would you need this? Personally, I use it a lot...

It makes use of the official WhatsApp.apk and the Android Debun Bridge software (ADB); currently, it only runs on Windows
