This is just a simple script i've wrote that installs WhatsApp to an Android device, just by running it
Why would you need this? Personally, I use it a lot...

I like to merge it into a single .exe file for easy usage, usually using WinRAR and releases will be that,
a standalone installer wich uses the same script

It makes use of the official WhatsApp.apk and the Android Debug Bridge software (ADB); currently, it only runs on Windows
